Hello everyone, I’d like to start off by saying welcome to my website and I hope you find something interesting or thought provoking in my blog posts. Consider this a mad man’s thoughts of how robots and “smart” devices could take over our world. Every day, as new technologies and designs make manufacturing cheaper and make new devices faster and better, some amazing devices become available to everyday consumers. Through this we go into an age where robots, smart devices, and other technologies are seen throughout our lives. 

This blog’s purpose is to have summaries, ideas, and detailed research about anything that relates to robotics and automation. For each article, I will start off by introducing the topic as a general problem set, I then try to wrap my head around the topic in terms of what I could see it be used for with robots or devices, and lastly I explain what is actually out there with possible references to what I wanted it for. The rest of the website are resumes, CVs, and other things relating to me.

Please feel free to comment on my posts, email me, or message me in any way you would like. I want you to enjoy what you read, have some good thoughts about what you see, and if you have any other ideas that you might want me to write about, please let me know. If you find something that doesn’t really make sense or if you see something wrong with what I have written, let me know, I do this for your pleasure.

Thanks so much and enjoy,

Emir Ljuca
