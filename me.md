To get a bit of a background of who I am, I am a Software Developer who is kind of moving around the market. I graduated with an electrical engineering degree, but my work experience has been in many different fields. Toward the beginning of my career I worked as a crew member for dunkin donuts, I worked as a bank teller at KeyBank, I worked a few weeks in landscaping and in a factory moving boxes for a toy company, I worked in school as a tutor for physics, chemistry, calculus and semi-conductor physics and as a TA for Electro-magnetic Fields course, I even worked as a janitor for a clean room at the RIT semi-conductor fabrication lab. For the more technical roles I worked in research with some of my professors first one in photonics and second on machine learning algorithms, and I worked in a few industries including Boeing, BAE Systems, and the Aerospace Corporation. Throughout my time in college I worked on multiple extracurricular projects like a robotic mouse that solves mazes, an emg analyzer that uses machine learning, and an all terrain robot for RIT SPC group.

Throughout my time working at these different roles I continued to get a breadth of knowledge that makes me a strong engineer I am today where I work at STR in Massachusetts which works with the military to make pretty advanced software. I will be going to school in ____ starting in 2021 as a robotics graduate student to increase my depth of knowledge in software and hardware.

I have a strong interest in everything that is engineering. Robotics is the perfect marriage of all engineering disciplines, it combines the knowledge of how arms and legs should move and how much force they can take before they break, it takes careful consideration for how much electrical energy the system should need to handle when moving or thinking about moving, and one needs to find ways to traverse areas by forming the right software which is tested and iterated upon such that the system moves intelligently. Robotics is the perfect area of study with someone with a large breadth of knowledge but with a large depth of knowledge of the important engineering disciplines.

With this blog I hope to not only entertain you with possible new thoughts on the automation field but also learn a lot myself. I want to even find groups of other passionate people who have worked with robots that might have some interesting thoughts about some ideas I lay out. Lastly I want to learn about what it is like developing content for others that is in a more creative space like writing.

Hopefully this gives you a good view of who I am and if you will find what I talk about interesting. Without further ado, here is the link to my first article! Enjoy.
